//!
//! Go implementation:
//! <https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/tree/v8.1.0/modules/light-clients/06-solomachine>
//!
//! This implementation does not follow the ICS-06 specification. In the spec,
//! the client state is only updated when changing the public key or diversifier;
//! for verifications, a signature is used as the proof. This is a poor design,
//! because as part of the verification you'd have to increment the sequence in
//! order to prevent replays attacks. This means the verify functions become
//! state-mutative. This is a different behavior from every other client type.
//!
//! Technically the client spec (ICS-02) doesn't say verifications can't mutate
//! state, but doing so is just weird. A verification is supposed be a query,
//! and a query shouldn't mutate state.
//!
//! In our case, if we want to allow state mutations in the verify functions,
//! the `Context` needs to have a `&mut dyn Storage` instead of a `&dyn Storage`
//! which is a big change with security implications. It's just not worth it to
//! make this big of a change just to accommendate the need of this one client.
//!
//! Instead, we make it such that each header is associated with a key-value pair
//! (the `Record`). Each client update, the record is updated. For verification,
//! we just check whether the user-provided record matches the one in the header.
//! I think, this is a much cleaner design.
//!
//! We also made the following changes:
//!
//! - removed the `diversifier` string
//! - removed timestamp
//! - removed the ability to change the public key
//! - only support Secp256k1 public keys
//!
//! The solo machine is only intended for dev purposes, so we want to keep it
//! simple and trim all the features we don't need. If you need these features
//! please let us know.
